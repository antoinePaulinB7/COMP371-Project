******************** CONTROLS *******************
• Using WASD moves the player in the world, forward [W], backward [S], left [A], right [D] relative to the Camera's LookAt direction
• Moving the mouse alters the Camera's LookAt position.
• [F] to toggle flashlight on/off.
• Change rendering mode for the model, i.e. points, lines, triangles based on keyboard input:
* [P] for points, [L] for lines, and [T] for triangles.

********************** ROLES *********************
  Melissa - Role 1:
• Make world models using Blender, and populate the world with them. Add some randomized elements like color, length, etc.

  Antoine - Role 2:
• Procedurally generated terrain using Perlin Noise.
• Handle coherent world generation with roads and input from others.

  Nicole - Role 3:
• First person camera/controls
• Generalized lighting system + player flashlight
• Collisions Implementation using Ray Casting
• Skybox Implementation
  
  Laura - Role 4:
• Updating PA2 models as part of the “exotic” architecture re-scaled and re-textured as buildings or other elements within this world. (remove spheres).
• Modify mouse controls to be more FPS-like, i.e. the camera moves with mouse movement all the time.
• Organize the report with Briana, create architecture diagrams and report content.

  Briana - Role 5:
• Make procedurally generated buildings out of cubes - Created 5 distinct building models with 7 textures and implemented randomized generation.
• Organize the report with Laura, create architecture diagrams and report content.
